# Vehicle Detection and Counter

This project uses the YOLO V8 model to detect and count vehicles in a video feed. The system labels each vehicle and provides a real-time count, making it useful for traffic monitoring and surveillance applications.

## Model Training
To train the YOLO V8 model on custom data, you need to prepare a dataset in the YOLO format. You can use tools like LabelImg to annotate your dataset.

- After preparing the dataset, modify the `config.yaml` file to point to the custom data.
- Start the training process by following the YOLO training instructions.
- Save your trained weights in the `models` directory.

## Dependencies
This project relies on the following Python packages:
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- TensorFlow/PyTorch (depending on your model configuration)
- other necessary dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
